# IMPORTANT UPDATE:

Unfortunately, the project is now dead. I was very enthusiastic and positive about it, but I've had no idea what I was going into. The scope and complexity is simply too great for a single person, and I don't have enough time, or the will to coordinate a team.

If any of you would like to continue my work, you are more than welcome, to fork it, and carry on.

Sorry, for failing your expectations, but when I'm out of my depth, I have to be honest with you, and myself.
